# reproducible-research-plotting-practice
Plotting practice for the coursera reproducible-research course

### Instructions:

To practice the plotting techniques you have learned so far, you will be making a graphic that explores relationships between variables. This practice is useful since we will later cover creating reproducible graphics in this class. You will be looking at a subset of a United States medical expenditures dataset with information on costs for different medical conditions and in different areas of the country.
